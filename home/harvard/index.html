  <h2>poetry w/ harvard sentences!</h2>
  <div id='intro'>
    <p>the harvard sentences were created by the harvard psycho-acoustic laboratory in the sixties. they wanted to quantify the degradation of audio thru radio &amp;c by having a standard,
    well behaved set of sentences to quiz people on. they're still used to this day to test communications equipment. i discovered them by accidentally enabling an unlabeled engineering mode test on my phone at low volume and forgetting it was on all night
  </p>
    <p>the sentences are constructed from a set of so-called phonemically balanced words, and made up of one syllable words except for precisely one two syllable word per sentence</p>
